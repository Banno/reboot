Dispatch
========

*Dispatch* is a library for asynchronous HTTP interaction. It provides
a Scala vocabulary for Java's [async-http-client][ahc].

```scala
import dispatch._
val doc = Http(host("ls.implicit.ly") OK as.String)
```

Because Dispatch is fully asynchronous, `doc` represents a *promise*
of the response as a string rather than the string itself. You can act
on the response once it's available with a *for-expression*.

```scala
for (docstr <- doc)
  println(doc)
```

This for-expression applies to any *successful* response that is
eventually produced. If no successful response is produced, nothing is
printed. This is how for-expressions work in general. Consider a more
familiar example:

```scala
val opt: Option[String] = None
for (optstr <- opt)
  println(optstr)
```

An *option* may or may not contain a value, just like a promise may or
may not produce a successful response. But while any given option
already knows what it is, a promise may not. So the promise behaves
asynchronously in for-expressions, to avoid holding up operations
subsequent that do not depend on its value.

As with options, you can assert that a promised value be available at
any time with the use of `apply`:

```scala
val docstr = doc()
```

But the wise use of promises defers this operation as long as is
practical, or doesn't perform it at all. To see how, keep reading.
