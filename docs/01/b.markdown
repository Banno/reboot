Working with multiple promises
------------------------------

If we want to compare the promised temperature in New York to Madrid,
we might apply both promises to compare the eventual values. We
certainly can't make a good comparison if only one or zero of the
values are available right now.

But if taking one hostage is bad, taking *n* hostages is worse. Higher
demands take longer to be met and the cost of monitoring each
prisoner, or applied promise, increases.

### Independent promises

Luckily, we don't have to apply promises to work with their values. We
can stage operations to occur as soon as those values are
availableâ€”even with more than one promise.

First, we'll assign some promised temperatures using the methods
defined on the last page.

```scala
val newyork = temperature("New York, USA")
val madrid = temperature("Madrid, Spain")
```

Dispatch is already working to fulfill both promises. But assuming as
we must that their values are not available, we can still lay out work
for them to do:


```scala
for {
  n <- newyork
  m <- madrid
} {
  if (n > m) println("It's hotter in New York")
  else  println("It's at least as hot in Madrid")
}
```

Like all for-expressions used with promises, this one doesn't block on
I/O at any point. We're effectively chaining callbacks for the time
when both promises say they are available.

### Yielding combined results

But this isn't a very flexible procedure. Let's generalize it by
yielding a promised value.

```scala
def tempCompare(locA: String, locB:String) = {
  val pa = temperature(locA)
  val pb = temperature(locB)
  for {
    a <- pa
    b <- pb
  } yield a.compare(b)
}
```

Now we have a method that promises an integer indicating the relative
temperatures of places *a* and *b*.

### Dependent promises and concurrency

You might be tempted to refactor the comparison method into a shorter
expression.

```scala
def sequentialTempCompare(locA: String, locB:String) =
  for {
    a <- temperature(locA)
    b <- temperature(locB)
  } yield a.compare(b)
```

It's still non-blocking, but it *doesn't perform the two requests in
parallel*. To understand why, think about the bindings of the values
*a* and *b*. They both represent promised values.

Although the above expression `temperature(locB)` doesn't reference
the value of *a*, **it could**. Since *a* is known we must be in the
future: we must be in deferred code.

And that's exactly the case. Each clause of the for-expression on a
promise represents a promise callback. This is necessary for cases
where one promised value depends on another. Independent promises
should be assigned outside for-expressions to maximize concurrency.
