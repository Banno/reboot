This release brings referential transparency to the `Req` type by
making it an immutable builder of `RequestBuilder` â€” that's right,
Spring fans, it's a factory-factory.

Previously `Req` was a type alias for the `RequestBuilder` class of
the underlying async-http-client library. This class is unfortunately
mutable, leading to unexpected behavior a referenced `val` is reused.

For programs that refer to `RequestBuilder` explicitly, this version
of Dispatch provides an implicit conversion from `Req` to
`RequestBuilder`. This conversion reintroduces mutable behavior and is
is annotated as *deprecated*.

The method `Req.build` is provided for backwards compatibility, but is
deprecated. Use `toRequest` or `toRequestBuilder` to access the
underlying interfaces explicitly.

This release also removes the `dispatch.Promise`-bridging methods that
were deprecated in version 0.10.
