The "reboot" of Dispatch has stabilized enough to enter its beta
cycle. For general information on the new library, see its
[readme][readme]. For background on the project, read this

If you haven't been following the reboot alphas, everything in this

alphas; see Herald for an implementation that is
[configured for Tumblr][herald].
