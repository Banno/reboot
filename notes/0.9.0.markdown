"Dispatch reboot" is now Dispatch. Please enjoy its NIO-based
asynchrony-by-default and English-language request handlers.

### Changes

There are only minor changes since 0.9.0-beta2:

* The addition of an `as.xml.Elem` handler.
* Promises are considered complete when they error out, and their
  `toString` method references thrown exceptions.

The library has been rewritten since 0.8.0 to use a different
underlying Java-based HTTP client, [async-http-client][ahc]. The best
way to understand the changes is to read and follow along with [the new
documentation][doc].

### Documentation

The project's main documentation site [reboot.databinder.net][doc]
is fully rewritten and the old documentation is relocated to the
[dispatch-classic][classic] subdomain.

### Extension modules

Extension modules in general have not be ported yet. The module "core"
includes OAuth interfaces since these are now handled by the
underlying library.
